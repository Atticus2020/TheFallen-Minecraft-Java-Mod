description='''
A story-driven, MASSIVE, irradiated, cave-world mod. Built by hand, this mod covers three dimensions: , ,
where humanity have descended into the depths below for survival, but finding only despair.
You wake in the depths of the Earth and must survive in the radioactive underground and discover out the rise and fall
of humanity- loaded with stunning and deadly biomes, nightmarish and violent creatures, and a whole lot of busted
firearms to riddle holes in this hellhole of a cavern mod.'''
